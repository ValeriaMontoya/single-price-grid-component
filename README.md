## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I was able to practice my CSS Grid skills, and actually it was pretty easy to organize the items on the container.  
Here you can see the container properties.

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 2fr);
  max-width: 700px;
}
```
